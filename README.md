# Inclind CPT WordPress Plugin

`inclind-cpt-plugin` is a WordPress plugin that was developed to remove the hassle of having to inject CPTs in themes or use bloated and untrustworthy plugins.

## Installation

For general WordPress installation:

1. Extract the zip release into the `wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Upload the release ZIP to the default WordPress plugin installer

## Usage

Ensure that the plugin is active.

Most usage and configuration is done within the `includes/class-inclind-cpt-register.php` file.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Please use a generator when generating or creating CPTs. I would recommend this tool:

Please follow the steps carefully.
